# CSC468-Programming-Interactive-Data-Visualization-for-the-Web

This course covers the fundamentals of data visualization and how to build interactive visualizations from scratch.  Topics include implementing common visualizations with JavaScript and D3 (e.g. scatter plots), techniques for more complex types of data (e.g. hierarchical, geospatial, network), and adapting existing implementations of advanced visualizations to new applications. The final project involves building a custom interactive visualization with a python back-end and a D3 front-end.
